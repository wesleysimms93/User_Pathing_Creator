# User_Pathing_Creator
User Pathing Creator is software that gives the user an interface so they can visualize, edit, and create g-code. The software will be saved in a FILE (Text?,CSV?,GRAH?) that can be viewed in other software. USC must be able to load the FILE into the program and load the information correctly into the user interface. The user interface must show capture locations with (ICON). When the user clicks (ICON) they should be shown a (Dropdown, Property List, New Window-donâ€™t like but acceptable) where they can change what type of picture will be taken.  After the user is done with editing and creating they are able to save the FILE for use in other Software.  
Notes:

	This can be separate software on a computer or on the server
